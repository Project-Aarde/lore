# Parvus Resource Extraction Corporation
PREC was founded by 7 miners who were among an entire company sent on the UES Aarde to ensure that the new colony could begin exploiting the resources of its final destination as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Upon realizing they never reached where they were supposed to, this group of miners organized into a cooperative and began gathering vital supplies from the Parvus asteroid cluster, and later the planet itself. Today they have restructured into a top-down corporate hierarchy, with the 7 founders at the top, each occupying a C-level position.
