# Aarde Archaeological Society
A decade after the colonists were awaken in Heim on their nearly derelict vessel, many of them had flown out and landed on various planets in the star system. All was well - buildings were built, farms were planted, all appeared to be going as well as it could. One day, an adventuring hobbyist cave explorer was climbing through a rather large cavern on Kelima, near the capital colony of Kalima Prime. Incredibly, in the darkness, he began noticing what appeared to be structures. Shining her flashlight upon them, she noticed they were indeed such. But how could this be? No human had ever stepped on this planet before, and the ruined building ahead appeared to be ancient.

rushing back to Kalima Prime, she raised the alarm with local officials, who initially didn't believe her. One, however, was inclined to climb down the cavern himself to witness the sight. He was a retired archaeologist, and well into his 70s, but still a spritely fellow and most certainly capable of traversing the perilous path down the loose gravel and slippery rock.

blah blah blah, need to flish this out, old guy and cave climber go back down, they see the incredible ruins, and old guy finds some other retired colleagues and with them forms the Aarde Archaeological Society.
