# Project Aarde
It was the late 24th century. For hundreds of years, humanity had dreamt of exploring space - the great beyond. For centuries, hopes of scientific breakthroughs relating to fantastical technologies such as faster-than-light travel were stoked, and then quickly squashed once their physical impossibility had been thoroughly proven. Yet the yearning to leave our home planet never went away. With global temperatures approaching critical levels, it was clear to most that humanity's time on Earth was numbered. Centuries of pollution, looting of natural resources, and ever-growing engineering projects had rendered it all but inhospitable for most of the year. Only during select weeks of Autumn and Spring was it safe to exit the protective housings and habitats and breathe in the unfiltered air.

This couldn't go on. The answer was evident - colonization. The technology was available, as the Moon had been settled many decades prior, and now hosts the richest and most affluent of human society. Several startups acquired Federal grants from the United Earth Bank and set to building the first long-range colony ships. Still lacking the technology necessary to speed the process up of getting to their final destinations, they settled on an alternate approach: cryopreservation.

Hundreds of ships were constructed in a short a time as possible, thousands of people selected by lottery, and dozens of confirmed exoplanet-hosting star systems painstakingly surveyed using ground-based and orbital observatories. In the end, each colony ship was given its destination, all of its passengers frozen, and the controls handed off to the AI controllers. Their mission - to travel out into the darkness of space and find a better life. 

## UES Aarde

Among the hundreds of colony ships, and by no means remarkable or unique in any way, was the United Earth Ship Aarde. Its goal was much like the others, its parameters only slightly different. Yet, coincidentally, its path would not take it straight. No, unfortunately for its AI crew and frozen passengers, a rogue cosmic ray would find its way through a manufacturing imperfection it its thick layers of radioactive shielding and imprint itself on the central computer cores processing unit. The result: the pilot and main navigator would input a destination which is 0.0005% off its intended X-axis on the galactic coordinate grid.

While this may not seem like much, this regrettable though unavoidable incident would be the reason why the UES Aarde would find itself stuck in the gravity well of a large gas giant orbiting a star 300 lightyears away from its final intended destination. Luckily, the AI crew would manage to stabilize the orbit of the ship, lest it be crushed by the intense pressures in the upper atmosphere of the planet beneath.

And there the ship stayed, orbiting an unnamed gas giant, in an unknown star system, hundreds of lightyears away from Earth, and several hundred away from where it was meant to be. And it would stay there for another 1000 years. Long enough for the components aboard the ship to begin malfunctioning, and main power to begin fluctuating. Curiously, all but one of the AI crewmembers had boarded a lifeboat, believing that they had reached their destination centuries ago. Ships logs hold no record of where they set off to, or why.

## Orbital Station A1

Once main power had begun to fail, the emergency cryopreservation procedures were triggered. Thousands of colonists found themselves awaking, expecting to have landed on an exoplanet which had been proven to be safe for human habitation. Unfortunately not. Upon gazing out their nearest view ports, through the thick silica glass panels, they would see only the blackness of deep space.

The single AI controller who was left had deactivated itself a hundred years prior, and was now inactive for long enough where its internal memory modules would have corrupted from being unpowered. The central computer core contained many uncorrupted chunks, enough to explain how and why the passengers ended up where they had. Reading through them, the reality of the situation would begin to set in.

In the years to follow, the UES Aarde would be stripped of its engine parts, and other unnecessary components. Only the life support systems, power, and computer would remain, along with any miscellaneous systems required. The ship, now having lost much of its identity as such, would be renamed to "Orbital Station A1", and the salvaged components used to construct new shuttles.

The goal now was evident: to play the hand which was dealt to them. To explore the system they were in, to ensure their continued survival, and maybe, just maybe, get in contact with Earth, or what remained of it. 

The year is 3578.
